Description: Multi-client traffic generator inspired by hping3
 fluxgen is a powerful multi-client traffic generator that simulates
 many clients on a single Linux host, sending customizable network
 traffic with spoofed IP/MAC addresses from the same subnet.
 .
 Features include:
  - Multi-client simulation from a single host
  - Protocol support: TCP, UDP, ICMP, IGMP, GRE, ESP, AH, SCTP
  - Spoofed identities with unique IP/MAC per client
  - Flexible traffic patterns with randomization
  - Custom payloads (text or hex-encoded)
  - Traffic capture to PCAP files
  - Flood mode for load testing
  - YAML/JSON configuration support
